Status Update - March 29, 2024
Challenges:
Discoveries:
One of the challenges we've discovered about our project is the complexity of integrating third-party APIs for data retrieval. While we anticipated some difficulties, the intricacies of handling rate limits and data formatting were more extensive than initially expected.
Adaptation:
To adapt to these challenges, we've revised our timeline to allocate more time for API integration and testing. Additionally, we've sought guidance from experts in API integration to streamline our approach and mitigate potential roadblocks.
Non-Technical Challenges:
In addition to technical hurdles, unexpected non-technical challenges have arisen, such as coordinating schedules among team members due to conflicting commitments. We've addressed this by implementing a more flexible meeting schedule and leveraging communication tools to ensure everyone remains informed and engaged.
Collaboration/Communication:
Team Collaboration:
Our team has faced challenges in collaborating effectively, primarily due to differing levels of expertise and communication styles. However, we've overcome these challenges by fostering open dialogue and establishing clear roles and responsibilities. Successful collaboration instances include brainstorming sessions where diverse perspectives led to innovative solutions.

Progress:
Progress Rating:
This week, we rate our progress as 7 out of 10.
Measurement:
Progress is measured by the completion of key milestones, including database setup, API integration, and UI improvements.
Rating Justification:
We've given this rating because we've successfully completed database setup and made significant strides in API integration. However, we encountered delays in UI development due to unexpected design challenges.
